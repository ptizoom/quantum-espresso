You can contribute to a better Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO, even as an ordinary user, by:

<UL>
<LI>Answering other people's questions on the mailing list (correct
  answers are strongly preferred to wrong ones). 
</LI>
<LI>Porting to new/unsupported architectures or configurations: see
  Sect. <A HREF="#SubSec:Inst">3.1</A>, "Installation mechanism". You should
  not need to add new preprocessing flags, but if you do, 
  see Sect. <A HREF="#SubSec:CPP">5.1</A>, "Preprocessing".

2 How to become a developer</A>
</H1>

<P>
If you want to get involved as a developer and contribute serious
or nontrivial stuff (or even simple and trivial stuff), you should
first of all register for the Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO project on <TT>qe-forge.org</TT>. Please 
introduce yourself when you register so that the administrator 
knows that you are a real person. 

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00031000000000000000">
2.1 About <TT>qe-forge.org</TT></A>
</H2>

<P>
<TT>qe-forge.org</TT> is the portal for Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO developers, contributors,
and for anybody else wanting to develop a project in the
field of atomistic simulations.  <TT>qe-forge.org</TT> provides a CVS 
or SVN repository, mailing lists, a wiki, upload space, a
bug tracking facility, various other tools that are useful 
for developers. You can use either CVS or SVN but not both
together. Note that the usage of the wiki provided by <TT>qe-forge.org</TT> 
is currently disabled for security reasons.

<P>
You can open your own project, retaining all rights on it (including 
the right not to release anything); or else, you can register as a 
developer in an existing project (or both).

<P>
Currently Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO uses the following development tools:

<UL>
<LI>SVN server (with web interface to browse the repository)
</LI>
<LI>Bug Tracking facility
</LI>
<LI>Upload space (with download counter)
</LI>
<LI>Mailing lists <TT>q-e-commits</TT> and <TT>q-e-developers</TT>.
</LI>
</UL>
Everybody is encouraged to explore other capabilities of <TT>qe-forge.org</TT>.

<P>
Once you are registered, you need to register your SSH keys in order
to have read-write access the CVS or SVN repository (if you have been
allowed by the project leader). The procedure is as follows:

<UL>
<LI>login to your <TT>qe-forge.org</TT> account
</LI>
<LI>click on My stuff (menu on top line)
</LI>
<LI>click on My account (menu on the left)
</LI>
<LI>click on Edit SSH Keys, follow the instructions to add your keys
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
If you want to become a Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO developer, you should subscribe to
the two mailing lists

<UL>
<LI><TT>q-e-developers</TT> (low-traffic):
for communications among developers and people interested
in the development of Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO
</LI>
<LI><TT>q-e-commits</TT> (not-so-low traffic): for commit messages.
</LI>
</UL>
Subscription is not automatic when you register: you should
subscribe using the links in
<TT>http://www.qe-forge.org/gf/project/q-e/mailman/</TT>.

2.2 Contributing new developments</A>
</H2>

<P>
Various procedures can be followed to contribute new developments.
The ideal procedure depends upon the kind of project you have in
mind. In all cases, you should learn how to use SVN: see Sect.<A HREF="#Sec:SVN">10</A>, 
"Using SVN". The three typical cases are:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>a)</DT>
<DD>If your project involves changes or additions affecting only 
a small part of Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO, it is usually convenient to work directly on 
the SVN trunk.
</DD>
<DT>b)</DT>
<DD>If your project involves major or extensive changes to the core of
Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO, it may be a good idea to make a SVN "branch" and work on it.
</DD>
<DT>c)</DT>
<DD>If your project involves a major new addition (e.g. a new package),
or if you do not want it to be public during its development,
it may be a good idea to register it as a new <TT>qe-forge.org</TT> project
with a separate SVN repository. It is possible to make it visible
into the SVN repository of Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO. It is possible to restrict access
to selected Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO developers, or to keep it private.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
For case a), you should from time to time update your copy (using command
<TT>svn update</TT>), verify if changes made meanwhile by other developers
conflict with your changes. Conflicts are in most cases easy to solve:
see Sect. <A HREF="#SubSec:Conflicts">10.2</A> for hints on how to 
remove conflicts and on how to figure out what went wrong.
Once you are happy with your modified version, you can commit your
changes, or ask one of the expert developers to do this if you do not
feel confident enough.

<P>
For case b), you should from time to time align your branch with the
trunk.

<P>
For case c): if your project is ``loosely coupled'' to Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO, that is,
it just uses the Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO installation procedure and/or data files, there
shouldn't be any major problems, since major incompatible changes are
very rare (note however that the files produced by the phonon code
change more frequently). If your project is ``tightly bound'', i.e. 
it uses routines from Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO, it is prudent to notify the other
developers.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00033000000000000000">
2.3 Hints, Caveats, Do's and Dont's for developers</A>
</H2>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Before doing anything, inquire whether it is already there,
or under development. In particular, check (and update) the "Road Map"
page <TT>www.quantum-espresso.org/?page_id=564</TT>, send a message to
<TT>q-e-developers</TT>.
</LI>
<LI>Before starting writing code, inquire whether you can reuse
code that is already available in the distribution. Avoid redundancy: 
the only bug-free software line is the one that doesn't exist.
</LI>
<LI>When you make some changes:

<UL>
<LI>Check that are not spoiling other people's work. In particular, 
search the distribution for codes using the routine or module you are 
modifying and change its usage or its calling arguments everywhere.
Use the commit message to notify all developers if you introduce any 
``dangerous'' change (i.e. susceptible to break some features or 
packages, including external packages using Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO).
</LI>
<LI>Do not forget that your changes must work on many different 
combinations of hardware and software, in both serial and parallel execution.
</LI>
<LI>Do not forget that your changes must work for a wide variety of
different system: if your code works only in some selected case, it
must either stop or issue a warning in all other cases.
</LI>
<LI>Do not forget that your changes must work on systems of wildly
different computational size: solutions that may look appropriate in
crystal silicon may gobble a disproportionate amount of time and/or
memory in a 1000-atom cell.
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>Document your contributions:

<UL>
<LI>If you modify what a code can do, or introduce
incompatibilities with previous versions (e.g. old data file 
no longer readable, old input no longer valid), report it in
file <TT>Doc/release-notes</TT>.
</LI>
<LI>If you add/modify/remove input variables, document
it in the appropriate file 
<BR><TT>INPUT_*.def</TT>; if
you remove an input variable, update tests and examples
accordingly.
</LI>
<LI>All newly introduced features or variables must be 
accompanied by an example or a test or both (either a 
new one or a modified existing test or example).
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>Please do not include files (any kind, including
pseudopotential files) with DOS ^M characters or 
tabulators ^I. 
</LI>
</UL>
When you modify the program sources, run the
<TT>install/makedeps.sh</TT>  script  or type <TT>make depend</TT> 
to update files <TT>make.depend</TT> in the various 
subdirectories.

2.4 Guidelines for reporting bugs
</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Before deciding that a problem is due to a bug in the codes, 
verify if it is reproducible on different machines/architectures/phases 
of the moon: erratic or irreproducible problems, especially in parallel
execution, are often an indication of buggy compilers or libraries
</LI>
<LI>Bug reports should preferably be filed using the bug tracking 
facility at <TT>qe-forge.org</TT>:
<BR><TT>http://qe-forge.org/gf/project/q-e/tracker</TT>
</LI>
<LI>Bug reports should include enough information to be reproduced: 
typically, version number, hardware/software combination(s) for which 
the problem arises, whether it happens in serial or parallel
execution or both, and, most important, an input and output
exhibiting such behavior (fast to execute if possible). The error
message alone is usually not a sufficient piece of information. 
</LI>
<LI>If a bug is found in a stable (released) version of Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO, it must
be reported in the <TT>Doc/release-notes</TT> file.

3.0.1  Libraries</A>
</H3>

<P>
Subdirectory <TT>flib/</TT> contains libraries written in fortran77 
(<TT>*.f</TT>) and in fortran-90 (<TT>*.f90</TT>).
The latter should not depend on any module, except for modules
<TT>kinds</TT> and <TT>constants</TT>.

<P>
Subdirectory <TT>clib/</TT> contains libraries written in C 
(<TT>*.c</TT>). Functions that are called by fortran
should be preprocessed using the macros:

<OL>
<LI><TT>F77_FUNC (func,FUNC)</TT> for function <TT>func</TT>, not containing underscore(s) in name 
</LI>
<LI><TT>F77_FUNC_(f_nc,F_NC)</TT> for function <TT>f_nc</TT>, containing underscore(s) in name
</LI>
</OL>
These macros are defined in file <TT>include/c_defs.h</TT>. This file must be included
by all <TT>*.c</TT> files. The macros are automagically generated by 
<TT>configure</TT> and 
choose the correct case 
(lowercase or uppercase) and the correct number of final underscores. 
See file <TT>include/defs.h.README</TT> for more info.

<P>

3.1 Installation mechanism</A>
</H2>

<P>
<A NAME="SubSec:Inst"></A>The code contains C-style preprocessing directives. There are two ways to do preprocessing of fortran files:

<UL>
<LI>directly with the fortran compiler, if supported;
</LI>
<LI>by first pre-compiling with the C preprocessor <TT>cpp</TT>.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
In the first case, one needs to specify in the <TT>make.sys</TT> file the fortran compiler option that tells the compiler to pre-process first. In the second case, one needs to
specify the C precompiler and options (if needed) in <TT>make.sys</TT>.
Normally, <TT>configure</TT> should take care of this.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00041100000000000000">
3.1.1  How to edit the <TT>configure</TT> script</A>
</H3>

<P>
The <TT>configure</TT> script is generated from its source file
<TT>configure.ac</TT> by the GNU <TT>autoconf</TT> utility
(<TT>http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/</TT>).  Don't edit <TT>configure</TT> directly: whenever it gets regenerated, your changes will be lost.
Instead, go to the <TT>install/</TT> directory, edit <TT>configure.ac</TT>, 
then run <TT>autoconf</TT> to regenerate <TT>configure</TT>. If you want 
to keep the old <TT>configure</TT>, make a copy
first.

<P>
GNU <TT>autoconf</TT> is installed by default on most Unix/Linux systems.  If
you don't have it on your system, you'll have to install it. You will
need a recent version (e.g. v.2.65) of <TT>autoconf</TT>, because our <TT>configure.ac</TT>
file uses recent syntax.

<P>
<TT>configure.ac</TT> is a regular Bourne shell script (i.e., "sh" - not csh!), 
except that:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>-</DT>
<DD>capitalized names starting with "AC_" are <TT>autoconf</TT> macros.  Normally you shouldn't have to touch them.
</DD>
<DT>-</DT>
<DD>square brackets are normally removed by the macro processor.  If you need a square bracket (that should be very rare), you'll have to write two.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
You may refer to the GNU <TT>autoconf</TT> Manual for more info.

<P>
<TT>make.sys.in</TT> is the source file for <TT>make.sys</TT>, that
<TT>configure</TT> generates: you might want to edit that file as well. 
The generation procedure is as follows: if <TT>configure.ac</TT> contains the macro
"AC_SUBST(name)", then every occurrence of "@name@" in the source
file will be substituted with the value of the shell variable "name"
at the point where AC_SUBST was called.

<P>
Similarly, <TT>configure.msg</TT> is generated from <TT>configure.msg.in</TT>: this
file is only used by <TT>configure</TT> to print its final report, and isn't
needed for the compilation.  We did it this way so that our
<TT>configure</TT> may also be used by other projects, just by replacing the
Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO-specific <TT>configure.msg.in</TT> by your own.

<P>
<TT>configure</TT> writes a detailed log of its operation to <TT>config.log</TT>.
When any configuration step fails, you may look there for the relevant
error messages.  Note that it is normal for some checks to fail.

3.1.2 How to add support for a new architecture</A>
</H3>

<P>
In order to support a previously unsupported architecture, first you
have to figure out which compilers, compilation flags, libraries
etc. should be used on that architecture.
In other words, you have to write a <TT>make.sys</TT> that works: you may use
the manual configuration procedure for that (see the 
User Guide).  Then, you have to modify <TT>configure</TT> so that it can
generate that <TT>make.sys</TT> automatically.

<P>
To do that, you have to add the case for your architecture in several
places throughout <TT>configure.ac</TT>:

<OL>
<LI>Detect architecture

<P>
Look for these lines:
<PRE>
  if test "$arch" = ""
  then
          case $host in
                  ia64-*-linux-gnu )      arch=ia64   ;;
                  x86_64-*-linux-gnu )    arch=x86_64 ;;
                  *-pc-linux-gnu )        arch=ia32   ;;
                  etc.
</PRE>
Here you must add an entry corresponding to your architecture and
operating system.  Run <TT>config.guess</TT> to obtain the string identifying
your system.
For instance on a PC it may be "i686-pc-linux-gnu", while on IBM SP4
"powerpc-ibm-aix5.1.0.0".  It is convenient to put some asterisks to
account for small variations of the string for different machines of
the same family.  For instance, it could be "aix4.3" instead of
"aix5.1", or "athlon" instead of "i686"...

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Select compilers

<P>
Look for these lines:

<P>
<PRE>
  # candidate compilers and flags based on architecture
  case $arch in
  ia64 | x86_64 )
        ...
  ia32 )
        ...
  aix )
        ...
  etc.
</PRE>

<P>
Add an entry for your value of $arch, and set there the appropriate
values for several variables, if needed (all variables are assigned
some reasonable default value, defined before the "case" block):

<P>
- "try_f90" should contain the list of candidate Fortran 90 compilers,
in order of decreasing preference (i.e. configure will use the first
it finds).  If your system has parallel compilers, you should list
them in "try_mpif90".

<P>
- "try_ar", "try_arflags": for these, the values "ar" and "ruv" should
be always fine, unless some special flag is required (e.g., -X64
With sp4).  

<P>
- you should define "try_dflags" if there is
any
"#ifdef" specific to your machine: for instance, on IBM machines,
"try_dflags=-D__AIX" . A list of such flags can be found in file 
<TT>include/defs.h.README</TT>.

<P>
You shouldn't need to define the following:
- "try_iflags" should be set to the appropriate "-I" option(s)
needed by the preprocessor or by the compiler to locate *.h files
to be included; try_iflags="-I../include" should be good for most cases

<P>
For example, here's the entry for IBM machines running AIX:
<PRE>
   aix )
        try_mpif90="mpxlf90_r mpxlf90"
        try_f90="xlf90_r xlf90 $try_f90"
        try_arflags="-X64 ruv"
        try_arflags_dynamic="-X64 ruv"
        try_dflags="-D__AIX -D__XLF"
        ;;
</PRE>
The following step is to look for both serial and parallel fortran
compilers:
<PRE>
  # check serial Fortran 90 compiler...
  ...
  AC_PROG_F77($f90)
  ...
        # check parallel Fortran 90 compiler
  ...
        AC_PROG_F77($mpif90)
  ...
  echo setting F90... $f90
  echo setting MPIF90... $mpif90
</PRE>
A few compilers require some extra work here: for instance, if the
Intel Fortran compiler was selected, you need to know which version
because different versions need different flags.

<P>
At the end of the test,

<P>
- $mpif90 is the parallel compiler, if any; if no parallel compiler is found or if <TT>-disable-parallel</TT> was specified, $mpif90 is the serial compiler

<P>
- $f90 is the serial compiler

<P>
Next step: the choice of (serial) C and Fortran 77 compilers.
Look for these lines:
<PRE>
  # candidate C and f77 compilers good for all cases
  try_cc="cc gcc"
  try_f77="$f90"

  case "$arch:$f90" in
  *:f90 )
        ....
  etc.
</PRE>
Here you have to add an entry for your architecture, and since the 
correct choice of C and f77 compilers may depend on the fortran-90 
compiler, you may need to specify the f90 compiler as well.
Again, specify the compilers in try_cc and try_f77 in order of 
decreasing preference.  At the end of the test, 

<P>
- $cc is the C compiler

<P>
- $f77 is the Fortran 77 compiler, used to compile *.f files
(may coincide with $f90)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Specify compilation flags.

<P>
Look for these lines:
<PRE>
  # check Fortran compiler flags
  ...
  case "$arch:$f90" in
  ia64:ifort* | x86_64:ifort* )
        ...
  ia64:ifc* )
        ...
  etc.
</PRE>
Add an entry for your case and define:

<P>
- "try_fflags": flags for Fortran 77 compiler.

<P>
- "try_f90flags": flags for Fortran 90 compiler.
In most cases they will be the same as in Fortran 77 plus some
others.  In that case, define them as "$(FFLAGS) -something_else".

<P>
- "try_fflags_noopt": flags for Fortran 77 with all optimizations
turned off: this is usually "-O0".
These flags must be used for compiling flib/dlamch.f (part of our
version of Lapack): it won't work properly with optimization.

<P>
- "try_ldflags": flags for the linking phase (not including the list
of libraries: this is decided later). 

<P>
- "try_ldflags_static": additional flags to select static compilation
(i.e., don't use shared libraries).

<P>
- "try_dflags": must be defined if there is in the code any #ifdef
specific to your compiler (for instance, -D__INTEL for Intel
compilers).  Define it as "$try_dflags -D..." so that pre-existing
flags, if any, are preserved.

<P>
- if the Fortran 90 compiler is not able to invoke the C preprocessor
automatically before compiling, set "have_cpp=0" (the opposite case
is the default). The appropriate compilation rules will be generated 
accordingly. If the compiler requires that any flags be specified in
order to invoke the preprocessor (for example, "-fpp " - note the 
space), specify them in "pre_fdflags".

<P>
For example, here's the entry for ifort on Linux PC:
<PRE>
  ia32:ifort* )
          try_fflags="-O2 -tpp6 -assume byterecl"
          try_f90flags="\$(FFLAGS) -nomodule"
          try_fflags_noopt="-O0 -assume byterecl"
          try_ldflags=""
          try_ldflags_static="-static"
          try_dflags="$try_dflags -D__INTEL"
          pre_fdflags="-fpp "
          ;;
</PRE>
Next step: flags for the C compiler. Look for these lines:
<PRE>
  case "$arch:$cc" in
  *:icc )
        ...
  *:pgcc )
        ...
  etc.
</PRE>
Add an entry for your case and define:

<P>
- "try_cflags": flags for C compiler.

<P>
- "c_ldflags": flags for linking, when using the C compiler as linker.
This is needed to check for libraries written in C, such as FFTW.

<P>
- if you need a different preprocessor from the standard one ($CC -E),
define it in "try_cpp".

<P>
For example for XLC on AIX:
<PRE>
  aix:mpcc* | aix:xlc* | aix:cc )
          try_cflags="-q64 -O2"
          c_ldflags="-q64"
          ;;
</PRE>
Finally, if you have to use a nonstandard preprocessor, look for these
lines:
<PRE>
  echo $ECHO_N "setting CPPFLAGS... $ECHO_C"
  case $cpp in
        cpp) try_cppflags="-P -traditional" ;;
        fpp) try_cppflags="-P"              ;;
        ...
</PRE>
and set "try_cppflags" as appropriate.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Search for libraries

<P>
To instruct <TT>configure</TT> to search for libraries, you must tell it two
things: the names of libraries it should search for, and where it
should search.

<P>
The following libraries are searched for:

<P>
- BLAS or equivalent. 
Some vendor replacements for BLAS that are supported by Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO are:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
MKL on Linux, 32- and 64-bit Intel CPUs
<BR>
ACML on Linux, 64-bit AMD CPUs
<BR>
essl on AIX
<BR>
SCSL on sgi altix
<BR>
SUNperf on sparc

</BLOCKQUOTE>
Moreover, ATLAS is used over BLAS if available.

<P>
- LAPACK or equivalent. Some vendor replacements for LAPACK that are supported by Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO are:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
mkl on linux
    SUNperf on sparc

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
- FFTW (version 3) or another supported FFT library. The latter include:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
essl on aix
    ACML on Linux, 64-bit AMD CPUs
    SUNperf on sparc

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
- the MASS vector math library on aix

<P>
- an MPI library. This is often automatically linked by the compiler

<P>
If you have another replacement for the above libraries, you'll have
to insert a new entry in the appropriate place.

<P>
This is unfortunately a little bit too complex to explain.
Basic info: 
<BR>"AC_SEARCH_LIBS(function, name, ...)" looks for symbol
"function" in library "libname.a".  If that is found, "-lname" is
appended to the LIBS environment variable (initially empty).
The real thing is more complicated than just that because the
"-Ldirectory" option must be added to search in a nonstandard
directory, and because a given library may require other libraries as
prerequisites (for example, Lapack requires BLAS).

5.1 Preprocessing
</H2>
The code contains C-style preprocessing directives. Most fortran compilers directly support them; some don't, and preprocessing is ''hand-made'' by the makefile using the C preprocessor <TT>cpp</TT>. The C preprocessor may:

<UL>
<LI>assign a value to a given expression. For instance, command <TT>#define THIS that</TT>, or the option in the command line: <TT>-DTHIS=that</TT>, will replace all occurrence of <TT>THIS</TT> with <TT>that</TT>.
</LI>
<LI>include file (command <TT>#include</TT>)
</LI>
<LI>expand macros (command <TT>#define</TT>)
</LI>
<LI>execute conditional expressions such as
<PRE>
  #ifdef __expression
    ...code A...
  #else
    ...code B...
  #endif
</PRE>
If ''expression'' is defined (with a <TT>#define</TT> command 
or from the command line with option <TT>D__expression</TT>), 
then  <TT>...code A...</TT> is sent to output; otherwise 
<TT>...code B...</TT> is sent to output.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>
The file <TT>include/defs.h.README</TT> contains a list of definitions that are used in the code. In order to make  preprocessing options easy to see, preprocessing variables should start with 
two underscores, as <TT>__expression</TT> in the above example. Traditionally ''preprocessed'' variables are also written in uppercase.

6 Format of arrays containing charge density, potential, etc.</A>

The index of arrays used to store functions defined on 3D meshes is
actually a shorthand for three indices, following the FORTRAN convention
("leftmost index runs faster"). An example will explain this better.
Suppose you have a 3D array <TT>psi(nr1x,nr2x,nr3x)</TT>. FORTRAN
compilers store this array sequentially  in the computer RAM in the following way:

        psi(   1,   1,   1)
        psi(   2,   1,   1)
        ...
        psi(nr1x,   1,   1)
        psi(   1,   2,   1)
        psi(   2,   2,   1)
        ...
        psi(nr1x,   2,   1)
        ...

        psi(nr1x,nr2x,   1)

        psi(nr1x,nr2x,nr3x)
etc
</PRE>
Let <TT>ind</TT> be the position of the <TT>(i,j,k)</TT> element in the above list:
the following relation
<PRE>
        ind = i + (j - 1) * nr1x + (k - 1) *  nr2x * nr1x

holds. This should clarify the relation between 1D and 3D indexing. In real

The distinction between the dimensions of the FFT grid,

convenient in some cases that the two sets are not the same.

<LI>Replicated calculations may either be performed independently on 
each processor, or performed on one processor and broadcast to all
others. The first approach requires less programming, but it is unsafe:
in principle all processors should yield exactly the same results, if 
they work on the same data, but sometimes they don't (depending on the
machine, compiler, and libraries). Even a tiny difference in the last 
significant digit can eventually cause serious trouble if allowed to
 build up, especially when a replicated check is performed (in which
case the code may ''hang'' if the check yields different results on 
different processors). Never assume that the value of a variable produced 
by replicated calculations is exactly the same on all processors: when in 
doubt, broadcast the value calculated on a specific processor (the ''root'' 
processor) to all others.
</LI>
<LI>Routine <TT>errore</TT> should be called in parallel by all processors,
or else it will hang
</LI>
<LI>I/O operations: file opening, closing, and so on, are as a rule performed 
only on processor <TT>ionode</TT>. The correct way to check for errors is 
the following:

IF ( ionode ) THEN
   OPEN ( ..., IOSTAT=ierr )

9.1 Programming style (or lack of it)</A>
</H2>

<P>
There are currently no strict guidelines for developers. You
should however try to follow at least the following loose ones:

<UL>
<LI>Preprocessing options should be capitalized and start with 
two underscores. Examples: __AIX, __LINUX, ...
</LI>
<LI>Fortran commands should be capitalized: 
CALL something( )
</LI>
<LI>Variable names should be lowercase: <TT>foo = bar/2</TT>
</LI>
<LI>Indent DO's and IF's with three white spaces (editors like emacs will do this automatically for you)
</LI>
<LI>Do not write crammed code: leave spaces, insert empty separation lines
</LI>
<LI>Use comments (introduced by a !) to explain what is not obvious from 
the code. Remember that what is obvious to yoiu may not be obvious to other 
people. It is especially important to document what a routine does, what
it needs on input, what it produces on output. A few words of comment
may save hours of searches into the code for a pice of missing information.
</LI>
<LI>do not use machine-dependent extensions or sloppy syntax. Am example:
Standard f90 
requires that a &amp; is needed both at end of line AND at the beginning of 
continuation line if there is a character variable (inside ' ' or " ")
spanning two lines. Some compilers do not complain if the latter &amp; is 
missing, others do.
</LI>
<LI>use "dp" (defined in module ''kinds'') to define the type of real and complex variables
</LI>
<LI>all constants should be defined to be of kind "dp".  Preferred syntax: 0.0_dp.
</LI>
<LI>use "generic" intrinsic functions: SIN, COS, etc.
</LI>
<LI>conversions should be explicitely indicated. For conversions to real, 
use DBLE, or else REAL(...,KIND=dp). For conversions to complex, use 
CMPLX(...,...,KIND=dp). For complex conjugate, use CONJG.  For imaginary part, 
use AIMAG.  IMPORTANT: Do not use REAL or CMPLX without KIND=dp, or else you 
will lose precision (except when you take the real part of a 
double precision complex number).
</LI>
<LI>Do not use automatic arrays (e.g. <TT>REAL(dp) :: A(N)</TT> 
in a subroutine) except if you are sure that the array is small in all
cases: you may easily exceed the stack size if the arrays are large.
</LI>
<LI>Do not use pointers unless you have a good reason to: 
pointers may hinder optimization. Allocatable arrays should be used instead.
</LI>
<LI>If you use pointers, nullify them before performing tests on their
status.
</LI>
<LI>Beware fancy constructs like structures and pointers:
they look great on paper, but they have also the potential
to make a code unreadable, or to confuse the compiler.
Also, be careful with F90 array syntax and in particular with
array sections: they may turn out to be inefficient.
</LI>
<LI>Do not pass unallocated arrays as arguments, even in those cases where
they are not actually used inside the subroutine.
</LI>
<LI>Do not use any construct that is susceptible to be flagged as 
out-of-bounds error, even if no actual out-of-bound error takes place.
</LI>
<LI>Always use IMPLICIT NONE and define all local variables.
All variables passed as arguments to a routine should be defined as 
INTENT (IN), (OUT), or (INOUT). All variables from modules should be
explicitly specified via USE module, ONLY : variable
</LI>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000102000000000000000">
9.2 Adding or modifying input variables</A>
</H2>

<P>
New input variables should be added to 
''Modules/input_parameters.f90'',
then copied to the code internal variables in the ''input.f90''
subroutine. The namelists and cards parsers are in
''Modules/read_namelists.f90'' and ''Modules/read_cards.f90''.
Files ''input_parameters.f90'', ''read_namelists.f90'',
''read_cards.f90'' are shared by all codes, while each code
has its own version of ''input.f90''  used to copy input values
into internal variables

<P>
EXAMPLE:
suppose you need to add a new input variable called ''pippo''
to the namelist control, then:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>add pippo to the input_parameters.f90 file containing the
namelist control 
<PRE>
              INTEGER :: pippo = 0
              NAMELIST / control / ....., pippo
</PRE>
Remember: always set an initial value!

<P>
</LI>
<LI>add pippo to the control_default subroutine (contained in
module read_namelists.f90 ) 
<PRE>
               subroutine control_default( prog )
              ...
              IF( prog == 'PW' ) pippo = 10
              ...
              end subroutine
</PRE>
This routine sets the default value for pippo (can be different in
different codes) 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>add pippo to the control_bcast subroutine (contained in module
read_namelists.f90 ) 
 <PRE>
                subroutine control_bcast( )

10  Using SVN
</H1>
The package is available read-only using anonymous access to the Subversion 
(SVN) repository. Developers can have read-write access when needed. Note 
that the latest (development) version may not work properly, and sometimes 
not even compile properly. Use at your own risk. 

<P>
Subversion, also known as SVN, is a software that allows many
developers to work and maintain a single copy of a software in a
central location (repository).
It is installed by default on many Unix machines, or otherwise 
it can be very easily installed.
For the end user, SVN is rather similar to CVS:
if no advanced features are used, the basic commands are the same.
More information on SVN can be found here: 
<TT>http://subversion.apache.org/</TT>.

<P>
Follow the instructions in
<TT>http://qe-forge.org/gf/project/q-e/scmsvn</TT>,
under `Access Info'',
to check out (i.e.  download) the SVN repository in either 
read-write or anonymous mode.
The distribution will appear in directory <TT>trunk/espresso/</TT>.
Branches (i.e. sub-versions) will appear as separate directories.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000111000000000000000">
10.1 SVN operations</A>
</H2>

<P>
To update the code to the current version: 
<PRE>
  svn update
</PRE>
in the directory containing the distribution.
To see the difference between the current version and your modified 
copy:
<PRE>
  svn diff
</PRE>
To save your modified version into the repository:
(read-write access only):
<PRE>
  svn commit
</PRE>
If you also want to add a new file, before commiting give command
<PRE>
  svn add
</PRE>

<BR>
10.2 Removing conflicts
</H2>
When you update your working copy of the repository, 
you may encounter two types of conflicts:

<OL>
<LI>Somebody else has changed the same lines that you have
      modified. 
</LI>
<LI>Somebody else has changed something that has broken one
      or more functionalities of your modified version.
</LI>
</OL>
In the former case, look into the conflicting section: in most cases,
conflicts are trivial (format changes, white spaces) or easily solved 
(the part of the code you were modifying has been moved to another place,
for instance). In the latter case, sometimes the problem can also be
trivially solved (a variable has changed name or has been moved, a
subroutine is called with different arguments, etc.)

<P>
Sometimes, the conflict is not so easy to solve. In this case, you
can selectively update your repository at a given date, or at a given
revision number, using command (ARG=revision number, or {"date"}):
<PRE>
  svn update -r ARG
</PRE>
In this way you can locate which change is the culprit.

will also be very helpful in locating the problem.
Of course, communication with other developers will also help.
