This example shows how to use pw.x to calculate the total energy
and the band structure of fcc-Pt with a fully relativistic US-PP
which includes spin-orbit effects.

The calculation proceeds as follows:

1) make a self-consistent calculation for Pt (input=pt.scf.in,
   output=pt.scf.out). 

2) make a band structure calculation for Pt (input=pt.nscf.in,
   output=pt.nscf.out).
