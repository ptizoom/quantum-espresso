     Program PWSCF v.5.0.2 (svn rev. 10839) starts on  3Apr2014 at  8:38:29 

     This program is part of the open-source Quantum ESPRESSO suite
     for quantum simulation of materials; please cite

     in publications or presentations arising from this work. More details at
     http://www.quantum-espresso.org/quote

     Parallel version (MPI), running on     2 processors
     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =       2
     Reading input from /home/giannozz/trunk/espresso/PW/tests/hcth.in

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation      = HCTH ( 0  0  5  5 0)
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want


     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used
